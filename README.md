<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<!-- Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `wongsn`, `mahjong`, `wongsn`, `wongshennan`, `wongshennan`, `gmail`, `project_title`, `project_description` -->

You will implement a card game or turn based card-type game. The user or users will be identified by the system and be able to play a game where the server remembers something about the user and the game cannot be cheated by opening the browser dev tools.

### Problem Statement

> "Viwawa is a portal for casual browser-based multiplayer online games and creation of avatars called Wawas developed by Pendulab Private Limited. The company is based in Singapore."
> _[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viwawa)_

- Wahjong - Mahjong with Singapore rules used to be one of the top casual mahjong gaming site back in 2008
- Pendulab, the owner, was then acquired by a leading US-based private equity firm.
- As of 2020, Viwawa was officially shut down, leaving a void in the Gaming market
- Lack of free-to-play online mahjong games (non-app based)

##### Web Mahjong allows

- four-way multiplayer with real-time game updates (if you left a game the engine will automatically discard tiles upon the end of your turn)
- lobby and waiting room to chitchat and await friends
